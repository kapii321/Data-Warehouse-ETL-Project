# Data Warehouse ETL Project

A comprehensive end-to-end data warehousing solution implemented using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) that demonstrates the complete lifecycle of data warehouse development.


# Project Overview

This project demonstrates the full lifecycle of data warehouse development:

- Business process analysis and metrics definition
- Relational database design and implementation as a data source
- Data warehouse design and implementation
- ETL process development using SSIS
- Data generation for testing at scale
- MDX query implementation

# Repository Structure

**CreatingDW/:** SQL scripts for data warehouse schema
**CreatingRDB/:** SQL scripts for source database schema
**Descriptions/:** Documentation

- Business process specifications
- Key metrics definitions
- Table descriptions with data types
- Sample query documentation


**ETLProcessScripts/:** SSIS package SQL components
**GeneratingData/:**

- Python script for generating sample data
- PDF with sample data previews
- Generates 1M+ rows per table


**MDXQueries/:** 10 sample MDX queries for business intelligence

# Technologies Used

- Microsoft SQL Server
- SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)
- Visual Studio
- Python (for data generation)
- SQL (T-SQL)
- MDX (Multidimensional Expressions)

# Features

- Scalable data warehouse design
- Automated data generation supporting millions of records
- SSIS-based ETL pipeline
- Business intelligence queries
- OLAP cube implementation

# Project Implementation

The ETL process is implemented as an SSIS project in Visual Studio, integrating:

- Data extraction from source database
- Complex transformations
- Loading into dimensional model
- Error handling and logging

# Project Highlights

- Handles large-scale data (1M+ rows per table)
- Implements best practices in data warehouse design
- Includes comprehensive documentation
- Features automated data generation for testing
- Supports complex business intelligence queries

# Development Process

1. Business Requirements Analysis

- Identified key business processes
- Defined essential metrics
- Determined data requirements


2. Database Design

- Designed source database schema
- Implemented data warehouse star schema
- Created necessary indexes and constraints


3. ETL Pipeline Development

- Developed SSIS packages for data flow
- Implemented transformation logic
- Created loading processes
- Added error handling and logging
